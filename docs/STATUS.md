# RAI Status

This is the canonical project status after P6. Historical status in
`docs/superpowers/STATUS.md` remains useful for archaeology, but new sessions should start here.

## Current state

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Branch | `feat/rai-mvp-p0-p3` |
| Repo | `https://github.com/pavp/react-architecture-intelligence` |
| Product state | P0–P6 complete |
| Next phase | P7 — Distribution + install |
| Core boundary | `@rai/core` remains framework-agnostic |
| Next adapter | `@rai/adapter-next` loads through CLI composition, not core imports |
| MCP | `analyze_repo`, findings, diagnostics, `explain_finding`, `get_node`, drift/query/refactor tools active |

## Latest verified baseline

Latest full verification after P6:

```bash
pnpm test       # 45 files / 286 tests
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm lint
git diff --check
```

Latest MCP compatibility fix:

- Commit `fdb7f7f fix(mcp): avoid tuple schema for get node`
- Reason: OpenCode rejected tuple JSON Schema for `rai_get_node.byteRange`.
- Fix: MCP input now uses `{ start, end }`; internal `getNode` still receives `[start, end]`.

## Completed phases

| Phase | Status | Summary |
|-------|--------|---------|
| P0–P3 | Complete | MVP parse → fingerprint → memory → core analyzers → MCP thin slice. |
| P4 | Complete | Breadth + temporal: snapshots, drift, graph tools, backfill, lazy type resolver, more analyzers. |
| P5 | Complete | Codemod proposal/apply safety pipeline, proof persistence, real git workspace adapter. |
| P6 | Complete | Next adapter: detection, variant guard, enrichment, client-boundary-bloat, route-coupling, CLI adapter loading. |

## P6 real-project smoke

Target: `/Users/macbook/Documents/github/scaffold-nextjs-app`

Result through RAI MCP:

- 21 active opportunities
- 0 conflicts
- 0 suppressed
- 0 engine diagnostics
- severity split: 1 error, 6 warn, 14 info
- top direct duplication: `react/shared-extraction` in `common-grid` family

This validated:

- CLI analysis on a real Next app
- MCP server startup in OpenCode
- `analyze_repo`
- `explain_finding`
- `get_node`
- Next adapter loading without core framework coupling

## Current roadmap

See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

Immediate next work:

1. P7-S0 docs normalization is complete once this file and `docs/ROADMAP.md` are committed.
2. P7-S1 should design distribution/install: native dependency strategy, `rai install`, and `rai doctor`.

## Active guardrails

- Code is source of truth.
- Config tunes behavior.
- Findings are immutable/append-only.
- Memory changes only through explicit feedback tools.
- LLMs narrate; they must not invent findings or write implicit feedback.
- `packages/core` must stay framework-agnostic.
- Adapter code belongs outside core.
- Keep changes reviewable; split work above 400 changed lines unless user accepts exception.

## Useful commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
git status --short
```
